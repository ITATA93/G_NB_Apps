## Accomplished

## Decisions
- **Community skills opt-in**: Moved 3,103 community skills to `_resources/`. New projects start lean.
- **Output governance**: Created binding standard for where agents create files. No more scattered outputs.
- **Central references**: All instruction files now reference PLATFORM/ROUTING instead of duplicating.
